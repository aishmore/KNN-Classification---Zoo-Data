# KNN-Classification: Zoo Data

I applied k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm for the classification of animal classes based on trait/feature data.

## Data
Data taken from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Zoo

## Steps Taken
1. Importing libraries and data
2. Initial statistical evaluation and basic visualization
3. Preparing the data for using with KNN algorithm
4. Training the classifier
5. Testing and evaluating the classifier
6. Further exploration
